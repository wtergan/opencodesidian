# 📋 Projects

Active, time-bound initiatives with specific outcomes.

## What Makes a Project

- Has a **deadline** or target completion date
- Has a **specific outcome** or deliverable
- Requires multiple steps to complete
- Is currently active (not someday/maybe)

## Examples

- "Q1 Website Redesign"
- "Book Chapter Draft"
- "Conference Talk Prep"
- "Home Office Setup"

## Structure

Each project should have:
- Clear objectives
- Success criteria
- Progress log
- Next actions

Use the **Project Template** from `06_Metadata/Templates/`.

## When Complete

When a project is finished:
1. Add completion notes
2. Move to `04_Archive/Projects/`
3. Extract any reusable learnings to `03_Resources/`
