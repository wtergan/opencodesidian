## Adding Files

1. Drop files into `Unprocessed/`
2. Link to them in relevant notes
3. When organizing, move to `Organized/[folder]/`

## Linking in Notes

```markdown

```

## File Naming

Consider prefixes for quick identification:
- `screenshot-` for screen captures
- `diagram-` for diagrams
- `photo-` for photographs
- `doc-` for documents

## Maintenance

Periodically:
- Process `Unprocessed/` folder
- Check for orphaned files
- Remove unused attachments
