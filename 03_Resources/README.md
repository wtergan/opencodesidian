# 📚 Resources

Reference materials and topics of ongoing interest.

## What Makes a Resource

- **Topics of interest** regardless of current projects
- **Reference material** you might need later
- **Knowledge** you want to preserve
- Not tied to a specific timeline

## Examples

- "AI Research" - collected insights on AI/ML
- "Writing Tips" - techniques and advice
- "Programming" - code patterns, tools, tutorials
- "Books" - notes and summaries
- "Recipes" - cooking reference

## Structure

Organize by topic:
```
03_Resources/
├── AI/
├── Programming/
├── Writing/
├── Books/
└── ...
```

Use the **Research Note Template** for capturing new resources.

## Usage

When working on projects or exploring areas, search Resources for:
- Previous research
- Relevant techniques
- Patterns and examples

## Maintenance

Periodically review for:
- Outdated information
- Items to archive
- Notes to connect
